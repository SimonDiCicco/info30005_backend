                    I suffer from quite severe ADHD, due to my difficulty in maintaining attention it was extremely hard for me to seek out and find jobs by myself. I  applied for my first accounting job 2 years ago using Frontier. Since then I have travelled to Europe on several business trips and now work at the company's Sydney branch where I now supervises the training of interns. Frontier helped me a lot in connecting me with the company abd provided me with an amazing opportunity which has helped me become who I am today

                   Before Frontier, I was heavily reliant on my parents for everything. They had to work two jobs each just to provide for me and one of them also had to be in the house to make sure I didn't injure myself. Thanks to Frontier, I have found a job that I love, at a company that is perfectly equipped to help me with my disability. Now my parents have more time to do the things they love and I'm able to help my family with a steady source of income. Frontier's been so important in helping me find a company that suited me.
